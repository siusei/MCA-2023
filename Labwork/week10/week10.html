	    	<h2>Audio Similarity</h2>
		<p class="content">
				In this task, I generated audio similarity matrix with Python and I decided to reuse audios from last week along with the tracks provided in this week's demo. 
			<br><br>
				Here are the order and genres of the tracks:
			
				<dl>
				<dt><b>Tracks 0-3:</b> Classical and Classical Screen & Play genre<dt>
					<dd>- Track 0: One Summer Day</dd>
					<dd>- Track 1: A Journey</dd>
					<dd>- Track 2: Stroll</dd>
					<dd>- Track 3: Classical Demo</dd>
					<br>
				<dt><b>Tracks 4-6:</b> Rock genre</dt>
					<dd>- All tracks from demo collection</dd>
					<br>
				<dt><b>Tracks 7-9:</b> Country genre</dt>
					<dd>- All tracks from demo collection</dd>
				</dl>
   		 </p>
	    	 <p class="content">
	    		<h3>Chroma features</h3>
	    		<br>
	    			Based on these tracks, I first extracted the Chroma features in SonicVisualiser and visualised them on Python to observe the music patterns from each genre.
	    		<br><br>
	    			Below the Chromagrams (left) and mean Chroma feature vectors (right) of the 10 audios:
	    		<br><br>
				<img src="chroma_10tracks.png" width="40%"><img src="meanChroma.png" width="40%">
	    			<i><b>Notes:</b> 
					<br>1) Chromagram illustrates the each note's characteristics played in the audio across octaves. 
					<br>2) Mean Chroma Feature maps the average occurrence of all notes in an audio.
				</i>
	    	
	    		<br><br>
	    			According to the Chroma feature plots, they capture distinct differences in regards of the music structure, tonality, pitches and beats patterns for each genre based on the changes of colour and note vectors.
	    			<br><br>
			 		<b>For example,</b>
	    			<br><br>
	    			- <u>Tracks 0-3, as the classical music:</u> -
	    				<br>They initially appear to have a lower energy in volume and have a gradual increase in loudness as the audios progress toward the end. The plots of these four tracks depict that the music structure and layer are less complex because of the key scales and notes arrangement.
	    			<br><br>
	    			- <u>Tracks 4-6, as the rock genre:</u> -
	    				<br>The colour patterns, emphasise with brighter green colour, are consistence and concentrated, which suggests that the rock genre have a higher density and occurrence of all notes especially in the sharps and flats.
	    			<br><br>
	    			- <u>Tracks 7-9, as the country genre:</u> -
	    				<br>Music patterns are similar to the rock genre in regard to beats and consistency in notes. Nonetheless, the note density is comparatively scattered and there are obvious music sections of verse and chorus identified with the colour change.

		 </p>
	    
	    	 <p class="content">
			 <h3>Generating Similarity Matrices</h3>
			<br>
			 To visualise the track distances, I generated a 2D plot and a heat map matrices for all tracks.
			<br><br>
			 <b>2D plot of track distances in the level of C's and A's occurrence:</b>
			<br><br>
			 <img src="2Dtracks.png" width="60%">
			<br><br>
			 From this plot, it illustrates the physical distance between each genre, where audio tracks in the same genre tend to gather in the same space. 
			 It shows that the rock and country genre are closer with higher occurrence of C's and A's, whereas the classical tracks are totally separated from those two genre on a lower level of the graph.
			<br><br>
			 <b>Similarity matrices of all notes (left) and of C's and A's (right): </b>
			<br><br>
			 <img src="distance_allnotes.png" width="50%"><img src="distance_AC.png" width="50%">
			<br><br>
			 The similarity matrix visualises the numerical distance between the 10 tracks in a heat map. 
			 In the computed results, they also show that tracks in the same genre are illustrated closer to the dark blue colour (representing number 0). 
			 An interesting find out is that the rock and country tracks lay on the similar blue colour except for Track 9 (country music).
			<br><br>
			 Both computed similarity plots depict the nature and distance of each genre and tracks based on numerical data extracted from the Chromagram.
			 They all reflect that the genre of rock and country are similar, yet a difference in note density and structures. Whereas the classical genre are distinctly different from the other two genres.

		<h3>Transcription in MuseScore and SonicVisualiser</h3>
		<br><br>
			In this task, I have transcribed a new MIDI file in SonicVisualizer with the MuseScore file from Week 2.
		<br><br>
			Below are the audios and image scores of the original and transcribed versions:

		<h3>Transcription Analysis</h3>
		<br><br>
		Above this section, I displayed both score versions in image and audio formats.
		From comparing the transcription to the original, there are various inaccurate and missing data in the transcribed output, especially when observing the visual score.
		<br><br>
		Beginning with the audio clips, when listening and comparing the tracks, the overall structure of the transcribed output is identical to the original track in terms of the general melody, harmony and tempo. However, in analysing the details of the audio output, there are noticeable misinterpretation for the beginning chords, key scale, excess and clashing harmony, missing articulations, level of dynamic, prolonged resting bars at the end, etc. The general listening impression doesn’t sound as lively and cheerful as the original audio, rather it sounded flat and boring with the errors combined above.
		<br><br>
		These characteristics are more obvious when viewing from the image file. although the transcribed images illustrated that the automatic polyphonic transcription is able to preserve general properties like the pitches, melody, timings and structure of the original WAV file, it is unable to interpret all music notations in the exact format. For instance, the transcription is unable to capture the accurate key scale, speed, change of time signatures and clefs, shapes of melody, accidentals, articulations, but instead picked up some extremely high/low harmonic notes, as well as excess rest signs and bars in the outcome. Moreover, the misinterpretation of the note-length (using quarter notes as common beat value) and the extra bars extend the score pages from 6 to 10 and the bars from 125 to 306 in comparison to the original score.
		<br><br>
		Base on these analysis, performing automatic polyphonic transcription based on WAV file is difficult to extract accurate information of the music notations unless adjusting details with human perception considering the complexity of music structure and performed instruments.
