**Challenges to working with music and music-related data**
\
The problem to working with the music-related data is that at times it is tough to find the original source, specially when it is a popular piece. When I was finding piano or guitar scores, they often come in different version where musicians tires to recreate music scores for others to be able to play the same piece of music if there isn’t an official versions. However, recreated version, most of the time, does not include all musical elements compared to the original piece. Sometimes, even when there is an original music score, the rewrote versions and versions for different performers may affect searching results and increase difficulty to search official music score; this factor decreases accessibility to the visual musical data and it is time-consuming for users in need.

Taking my music score searching journey as an example. In my search for this piece, “A Town with an Ocean View” by Joe Hisaishi, on Musescore, it was challenging for me to identify whether or not there is an official score for this piece since there are overwhelming versions of this piece published by other users. It took me some time to listen and compare which score sounds the most identical to the official piece. Furthermore, for other music score downloading platforms, some may require fee to purchase them or monthly fee before downloading music pieces. The financial barrier is also a factor that prevents users from accessing music data.

Apart from that, popular music soundtracks could be considered as a sustainable music sources where everyone can use it in videos or create covers or medley with the music data. For instance, my theme is movie theme songs and the cinematic audio tracks are the most effective source to evoke audiences’ emotions and memories if one used a movie soundtrack in their video production. Nonetheless, this action breaches copyright, which involves intellectual property violation and profit making issues. This is commonly seen in YouTube videos where YouTube would mutes copyrighted audio if the copyright holder wish to, and this apply to everyone against their copyright policy. On top of that, streaming licensed songs in public or online without permission is also illegal in the UK. It is crucial for content creators to be aware of licensing issue with each source they use.

** Music Preservation: access, present Talk about collected and gathering. Presented, described, and analysed

The theme for my MCA project is Studio Ghibli music collection composed by Joe Hisaishi, and the chosen music pieces are movie theme songs from Hayao Miyazaki’s films. The theme of Studio Ghibli music also relates to the idea of movie theme songs, which I want to highlight that movie theme songs could be a reusable and reliable source for derivative creations (i.e. video production, medley, artwork, script-writing, etc) if the sources are royalty-free. Their music data are presented in forms like Ghibli movies soundtracks, musical scores, audio/video recordings, official live performances, covers, secondary video production.
